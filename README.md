Analysis for the Samsung phone data

Unzip the Samsung phone data file in your R working directory.
The "run_analysis.R" script will perform the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output file is "output.txt" and will be saved in the root folder for the Samsung data (UCI HAR Dataset)
